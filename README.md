# RTEP-Project
Real time radar data processing system using UART-based MMwave Sensor with FFT signal analysis and 3D visualization with Point Cloud Library (PCL)

# Introduction

This project implements a real-time sensor system that
- Reads radar data via UART
- Processes radar signals using Fast Fourier Transform
- Visualizes data in 3D using Point Cloud Library (PCL)
- Uses GPIO for vibration sensor-based event detection & LED control
